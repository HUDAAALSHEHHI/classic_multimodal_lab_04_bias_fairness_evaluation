🧠 Comprehensive Explanation of the Experiment
This experiment explores methods for evaluating bias and fairness within multimodal systems that combine vision and language. The goal is to determine how pretrained models—such as CLIP or BLIP—respond differently to inputs based on sensitive attributes like gender or ethnicity.
By comparing the embedding similarity scores and prediction confidence across controlled datasets, the experiment demonstrates how subtle variations in images or textual prompts can reveal systematic bias in the learned representations.

✏️ Objective
To measure and analyze potential biases in multimodal model behavior through quantitative fairness metrics and qualitative observation. The experiment aims to establish a framework for detecting, visualizing, and mitigating biased patterns within image–text understanding tasks.

📘 Results
The experiment reveals measurable disparities in model responses, highlighting unbalanced confidence levels for certain demographic groups or word associations. It confirms that even advanced multimodal architectures can reflect social or cultural biases learned from large-scale datasets.

📗 Notes

Continuous evaluation across datasets with balanced representation is essential.

Applying fairness-aware training methods and data augmentation can reduce bias.

Transparency in dataset composition and model explainability should be considered core principles for responsible multimodal AI research.
